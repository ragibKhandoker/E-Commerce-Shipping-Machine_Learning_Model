# 📦 E-Commerce Shipping Machine Learning Model

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **E-Commerce Shipping Machine Learning Model** is a Python-based data science project designed to analyze e-commerce shipping data and build predictive machine learning models for shipping performance.  
The project focuses on extracting insights from logistics data and predicting outcomes such as delivery time, shipment delays, and cost-related metrics.

This repository combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with a **reproducible machine learning pipeline**, making it suitable for academic use, portfolio demonstration, and real-world experimentation.

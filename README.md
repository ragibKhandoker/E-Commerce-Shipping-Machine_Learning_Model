# 📦 E-Commerce Shipping Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📝 Description
This project focuses on predicting **e-commerce shipping performance** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze logistics and shipment-related data to understand delivery behavior and predict outcomes such as **delivery delays, shipping time, and cost-related performance metrics**.

The study explores how operational and logistical factors — including shipment dates, distances, carrier types, weights, and order attributes — influence overall shipping efficiency. The project was developed as a practical machine learning pipeline combining **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **predictive modeling**.

The dataset contains multiple numerical and categorical features related to shipping operations. After comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA, several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to measure predictive performance.

The entire workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — was implemented in **Python** using popular data science libraries and documented through a reproducible Jupyter notebook and executable script.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of **numerical and categorical shipment attributes** related to e-commerce logistics.  
🔹 **Key attributes include:**
- 📅 Shipment dates and delivery timelines  
- 📍 Distance and location-related variables  
- 🚚 Carrier and shipping mode information  
- ⚖️ Package weight and order-related features  

🎯 **Target variables** include shipping performance indicators such as **delivery time**, **delay classification**, or **cost-related metrics** (depending on the modeling setup).

> ⚠️ Due to data usage constraints, the dataset is not publicly shared. However, all preprocessing steps, feature transformations, and modeling logic are fully documented in the notebook.

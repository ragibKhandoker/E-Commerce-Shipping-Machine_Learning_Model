Project name: E-Commerce Shipping Machine Learning Model

Short description:
A Python project that analyzes e-commerce shipping data and trains a machine learning model to predict shipping outcomes (e.g., delivery time / delays / cost-related metrics). It contains an exploratory notebook for data analysis and a runnable script to reproduce the model pipeline.

What’s included

08_24141162_22301202_06.ipynb: exploratory data analysis, visualization, feature engineering, and model training experiments.
project.py: project script implementing the core pipeline or utilities used by the notebook.
Key capabilities

Data cleaning and exploratory analysis to surface shipping patterns.
Feature engineering tailored for shipment attributes (dates, distances, carriers, weights, etc.).
Model training and evaluation to predict shipping performance metrics.
Reproducible notebook that documents experiments and results.
How to run (suggested)

Create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install dependencies:
Open the notebook with jupyter notebook to explore EDA and training cells.
Run python project.py to execute the scripted pipeline (check the file for CLI options).
Outputs

Trained model artifacts, evaluation metrics, and visualizations produced by the notebook and script.
Next steps I can do

Create a README.md file in the repository containing this content and a small usage section.
Generate a requirements.txt by scanning the notebook/script for imports.
Would you like me to add the README.md to the repo now?
